## üòÑ Hello! I'm Sergio 

I'm a student at Universidad de Santiago de Compostela, in my final year of **Computer Science and Mathematics**.

### üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Experience
- From September to December 2023 I completed an intership at [CITMAga](https://citmaga.gal/es/) helping in the development of reformulation techniques for complex optimization problems.
- On Summer 2023 I completed an internship at [Gradiant](https://github.com/Gradiant), developing an AI model for error detection in an industrial setting.

### ‚ö° Some of my projects
- I took part in [HackUDC](https://hackudc.gpul.org/) and our team won one of the prizes! You can check out the repo and demo [here](https://github.com/CastilloDel/costaCompas).
- I took part in [AdaByron](https://ada-byron.es/2023/nac/) competitive programming contest. Our team achieved 2nd place in the regional phase and reached 13th place in the national finals!
- I enjoy competitive programming, I have a couple of repositories dedicated to solving problems from [Acepta el Reto](https://github.com/sergio-alv-per/acepta-el-reto) and [Advent of Code](https://github.com/sergio-alv-per/advent-of-code-2023).
- I developed [VacunacionGal](https://twitter.com/VacunacionGal), an automated Twitter account that showed information about COVID-19 vaccination rates in Galicia.
